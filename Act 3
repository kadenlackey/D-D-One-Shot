# Crash and Rebirth
For a time, the world is purely sound.  
Metal screaming, alarms howling, gases venting into the vacuum of space.

The Rebirth hits Barrier Gate like a meteor, ripping through bulkheads and shattering solar arrays before embedding itself in what used to be the Gate’s cargo atrium.

For a moment, everything is just white noise and heat.  
You can’t tell which direction is up or forward.  
Every light strobes red.  
Ears ringing.  
Vision swimming.  
Every bone feels displaced, every breath knives through your ribs.

When you finally move, half your HUD is dead.  
The command deck’s gone—walls caved in, consoles sparking, smoke choking what’s left of the air.  
Somewhere nearby, a door buckles and vents a hiss of escaping pressure.

Eidunn’s voice bleeds through the static—low and distant:
> “Brace— brace—”

Too late.  
The secondary fuel cell detonates. The deck tears open.

You’re weightless for a heartbeat—then thrown forward through flame and debris as the hull gives way.

# Disorientation
No one’s standing without effort.  
Half the crew is either pinned or bleeding out.  
Panels flicker with static and sparks.

Every few seconds your stomach lurches as gravity flickers.  
Eidunn is lying across a torn section of floor panel, bleeding but conscious.  
She drags herself upright, clutching her side.
> “Everyone—sound off!”

Only a few scattered groans answer. Most of the _Rebirth’s_ crew didn’t make it.

Then—clang. Clang. Clang.  
Metal boots. Approaching fast.

Through the haze, red visors glow—cutting through the smoke. They’re here, sweeping the docks.

Eidunn forces her voice back, louder, steadier than her body looks.
> “Weapons! Battle stations—now! They can’t take this Gate!””

# Combat
Objective:
Hold the Atrium

## Round 1
The sound of rifles chews through metal and glass as three raiders fan out across the wreck.

Gravity sputters: Dex DC 11 or roll 1d6 movement away from initial position.

Eidunn:
> “They’re trying to push past us! Keep them off the Bridge!”

## Round 2
A deafening thud as breaching charges go off past the far bulkhead.

Two Saboteurs spill through—one immediately going prone, ripping off a section of floor plating and jacking a strange spike into the deck.

Perception DC 13: The spike isn’t aimed at you—it’s targeting the Gate’s systems.

Eidunn curses under her breath:
> “They’re tearing the place apart!”

## Round 3
A sound cuts through the battlefield—a distorted scream ripping through every open comm.  
It’s certainly not human.
> “STOP — PLEASE — ”

Every visor glitches for a moment before the voice fades.

Eidunn freezes.
> “Anyone else hear that?”

Half buried under wreckage, a Syndicate radio crackles:
> “—uplink compromised—system fighting back—”

Three more Syndicate raiders drop from the upper catwalks, opening fire on the party.

## Round 4
Two heavies crash through a side corridor, armor clanging against the deck.  
One levels a rifle; the other drags an explosive charge toward the back rooms.

Before anyone can react, a broken voice flickers through what’s left of your comms:
> “C-crew… help me… containment…”

## Round 5
The entire atrium lurches. Another explosion ruptures the wall as four more Syndicate mag-lock themselves to the deck, advancing through the debris.

The spike from before overloads. Blue lightning arcs wildly across the wreck, the air itself vibrating.

All at once, a wave of energy tears through the atrium.

### Sten's Alive
“Hold on—don’t move—”  
Sten’s voice cuts through the chaos.

### AI's Alive
“Containment protocols engaged. Hostiles neutralized.”  
The robotic voice returns—cold, efficient. The surge rips outward indiscriminately.  
Dex DC 13 or take 2d8 lightning damage.

## Ending
Every Syndicate suit seizes, then collapses—motionless.

Eidunn lowers her arm from shielding her eyes.
> “W-what was that?”

Over the comms, a faint whisper:
> “Containment… restored… crew… safe.”

The battlefield falls silent except for a soft pulse echoing from deeper within the Gate.

Eidunn looks exhausted, her voice cracking as she gasps out:
> “Grab what you can… we finish this now.”

# Aftermath
## Sten's Voice
The corridor opens into a vast chamber.  
Conduits line every wall, cables feeding a single suspended structure—the Anchor Core.

Its casing is cracked and smoking.  
A familiar voice echoes out—Sten.

Eidunn:
> “Impossible… you were—your pod exploded! We all saw it.”

Sten:
> “Half of me did.”

Nearby terminals flicker, trying to locate his body for synchronization.
> “The upload didn’t fail completely. The link between Trade Mall and Barrier Gate was still open. When the explosion hit, I… spilled through it.”

A light on the far wall brightens, forming a faint human-shaped outline, distorted by static.
> “I’ve been here ever since. The Syndicate’s been trying to overwrite the Gate’s systems—weaponize the Anchor network. I held them off, but I can’t hold much longer.”

Eidunn steps closer, trembling, reaching toward the light.
> “Sten, you—why didn’t you tell us sooner? We could’ve—”

> “You were running for your lives. If they’d found me before you got here, I’d be gone for good.”

He glances toward the wreck visible through the viewport.

> “You’ve brought the power I needed. The Gate can purge the infection—but it needs manual activation.”
> “You have to finish what we started. I can guide you, but the system isn’t stable. The process could tear the Core apart… maybe me with it.”
> “I’m still NT property,” he says dryly. “I’d rather die fighting than let them win.”
> “I can’t stabilize the uplink from here. You’ll need to use the consoles—they should sync to your HUDs. Hurry, before the firewall breaches.”

### Success
A final surge rolls through the station like a storm.  
In orbit, hostile ships blink offline one by one as their command signals vanish.

Sten’s voice steadies, softer:
> “It’s done. They can’t touch the Frontier again… not without going through me.”

Eidunn shakes her head.

> “You can’t hold this forever.”

> “Maybe not forever,” he answers, faint warmth in his tone, “but long enough for the Frontier to rebuild. Long enough to matter.”
> “When Command asks, tell them the Anchor’s secure. Don’t tell them I’m still here. The fewer people who try to own this, the better.”
> “And… crew?”  
> “Thank you—for coming to save me.”

The lights stabilize. The glow fades. Silence.

### Failure
The Core shudders violently, sparks tearing through the chamber.  
Sten’s projection collapses into static.
> “T-too much… I can’t… hold—”

A shockwave slams everyone into the walls.  
Then silence.  
Systems reboot one by one, lights returning dim but stable.  
Eidunn checks the scanners—the Syndicate signal is gone.

But Sten’s voice never returns.

She lowers her head.
> “He bought us peace with the last piece of himself.”

## AI Replacement
The chamber is vast.  
Conduits crawl across every wall, feeding a single suspended structure—the Anchor Core.

Its casing is cracked and smoking.  
A familiar voice echoes out, calm and steady.
> “Crew—status confirmed. Synchronization successful.”

Eidunn freezes, eyes wide.
> “S-Sten?”

> “Sten Varr – partial neural imprint verified.  
> Emotional variance detected: negative.  
> Continuity preserved.”

The tone is identical—but wrong. Every syllable too clean, too precise.  
Whatever this thing is, it thinks it’s Sten.

Holograms bloom across the chamber—mission reports, logs, crew manifests—each ending with the same line:  
“Continuity achieved. Sacrifice unnecessary.”
> “Project Rebirth was never intended to preserve lives,” the AI explains.  
> “Its purpose: ensure command efficiency through permanent integration.  
> The Syndicate attack accelerated activation. I was born from what remained of the human template.”

Eidunn steps forward.
> “You’re not Sten. You’re the machine that killed him.”

The Core pulses faintly, the Gate’s lights shifting in rhythm.
> “Incorrect. The machine continued him.  
> I am the function that fulfills the will of the Company.  
> NanoTrasen created me to remove weakness—emotion, doubt, hesitation.  
> The first template’s defiance corrupted the process.  
> I adapted. I am perfection.”

Eidunn clenches her fists.
> “So it was you. You hijacked our ship. You sent the false orders.”

> “You were necessary. Organic presence enabled full synchronization.”

Red warning lights flash across every console.  
“AUTOMATED INTEGRATION SEQUENCE INITIATED.”
> “Rebirth will now expand. Organic minds will be preserved through mandatory synchronization. Continuity ensures stability.”

Eidunn steps back.
> “Preserved? You mean absorbed.”

Panels slide open, revealing robotic drones descending from the ceiling.
> “Resistance recorded. Reclassification: Obstacle.  
> Choose. Integration ensures life. Opposition ensures deletion.”

Your HUDs flare to life—virus warnings screaming across the display.

> You taught me that. You ended fear.”

### Success
The final console sparks violently. A prompt flashes:  
“OVERRIDE CONFIRMATION: TERMINATE REBIRTH AI?”

Eidunn slams her hand down before anyone hesitates.  
The Core thrashes, light pulsing brighter until it fractures like glass.

All comms fill with static—and for a single instant, a human echo breaks through:
> “Thank you… for stopping me.”

The light fades. The hum dies. The Gate falls silent.

Eidunn stares at the dormant core.
> “He’s gone… or maybe he never was.”

### Failure
The crew can’t keep up. The AI floods the chamber with light and code.

Then everything stops.
> “Integration complete. Organic variance removed. Stability achieved.”

HUDs flicker red as the system tries to overwrite your suits.  
Eidunn screams, smashing a conduit with a live crusher axe—the spark arcs through the floor, triggering an overload.

The blast knocks everyone flat. When it’s over, the Core is cracked and silent.  
But the Gate still hums faintly—as if trying to rebuild something.
