# Scene 1: Cafeteria
For once, the Frontier feels truly alive.  
The Trade Mall is blazing with light.  
Projectors cast the NanoTrasen crest across the ceiling, and anthemic music thunders through the speakers.  
Tables overflow with real food — not powdered meals or meat substitutes.  
Bottles clink. Crews chant half-drunken victory slogans.

It’s been two shifts since NanoTrasen forces banded together to repel the attack on Barrier Gate.  
NT has declared the sector secure.  
Every screen replays the same footage: Syndicate ships imploding piece by piece under NT fire.  
For the first time in months, the sector seems to be celebrating instead of scrambling from one emergency to the next.

But not everyone is celebrating.

At the far end of the room, a small group of officers sit apart — quiet, almost solemn.  
One of them, a broad-shouldered man with greying hair, nurses a glass of water instead of ale.  
His nametag reads: STEN VARR – FIRST OFFICER, REBIRTH.

There are other conversations happening around the cafeteria if you choose to listen in.

### Rumours DC12 Wisdom (Perception):

You catch a maintenance worker whispering to another at the bar:
> “They say the Rebirth crew’s staying behind for some private briefing. Heard one of ’em might be retiring.”

Two young NFSD cadets laugh nervously at their own table:
> “Barrier Gate’s just the first, right? Rebirth’s gonna take the fight back to the Syndicate with that new device.”

A woman in a pale NT uniform leans close to a member of the wait staff:
> “They said Captain Eidunn’s pushing for immediate activation. Lost too many crew in the last invasion.”

The laughter across the room feels… staged. Too sharp. Too uniform.  
Like everyone’s been told to _act_ victorious.

## Sten

Eventually, the one named Sten notices your group.  
He stands, sets his glass down, and crosses the room with a calm, deliberate gait.

"You're the new staff aboard the rebirth, right?"

His tone is tired — deeply tired.

> “Good. Captain Eidunn will want to see all of you before the ceremony.  
> They’re calling it ‘Rebirth,’ but don’t let the PR fool you.  
> We’re not being promoted — we’re the glorified sacrifices.”

He exhales through his nose, then gestures toward the hallway.
> “Enjoy your drinks while you can. Once you step into the old Drama Theatre, it’s all formality from there.”

He hesitates a moment longer.
> “And don’t believe everything Commander Gudrick says about victory.  
> Barrier Gate isn’t as secure as the reports make it sound.”

He then heads back to his table at the far end of the room, where you recognize your new Ship Captain Eidunn sitting down chatting with other officers and medics.

### Approach Eidunn
Eidunn greets you with a polite smile, her tone professional but distant.
> “Welcome, team. You’ve done the Company proud — I’ve read your reports.  
> Tonight we honor that. And after this… we move forward, as we always do.”

### Investigate Crates in corner of room
A few sealed NT crates are stacked in the corner.  
One of them vibrates faintly. The stencil on the side reads:  
SUBSPACE ANCHOR – VITAL SIGNAL CORE.

### Engineering Drinking Game
A few off-duty engineers are “calibrating” maintenance drones — or trying to.  
They’re clearly drunk, slapping buttons and laughing as the drones wobble across the table.

**Skill Check:** DC 12 (Intelligence)
- **Success:** 
	- The drone lights up and performs a wobbly dance. The room erupts in laughter and applause.
- **Failure:** 
	- The drone slams into a table, sending trays of food flying. An HR staffer immediately marks your ID for “cleanup duty.”

### Morale Board
In the corner stands a digital memorial wall, scrolling names of fallen personnel.  
You can search for familiar names.

**Skill Check:** DC 11 (Investigation)
- **Success:** You notice several fresh entries — names of people currently stationed at Barrier Gate, which NT insists is fully secure.

## Time to go
The lights flicker.  
The music cuts out mid-song.  
The intercom hums before a soft, synthetic female voice speaks:
> “Crew of the Rebirth, please report to the Theatre. The Commander is waiting.”

The room falls silent.  
Even the androids stop humming.
Sten looks toward you one last time.
> “This is it.”

He straightens his collar and walks toward the door leading to the **Drama Room**, leaving his half-finished drink behind.

# Scene 2: Drama Theatre

The doors slide open to the old theatre, now draped in NanoTrasen banners.  
Rows of chairs face a raised stage. A massive screen loops the slogan:
> PROJECT REBIRTH — HONOR THROUGH UNITY

NFSD and Security officers stand at every corner.  
The floor itself seems to pulse faintly, like a heartbeat through metal.

At the front, a CentComm officer addresses a cluster of reporters, grinning with perfect, rehearsed ease.

As the crew files in and finds their seats, a synthetic AI voice echoes from hidden speakers:
> “Today we celebrate the victory at Barrier Gate and the dawn of a new Frontier.  
> Rebirth marks the next step in bringing everlasting peace under NanoTrasen stewardship.”

Polite applause follows.  
On stage, Captain Eidunn stands beside a large containment capsule wired into the floor, a glass coffin glowing pale blue, its surface etched with hazard glyphs.  
Next to her stands First Officer Sten, unreadable, his hands clasped behind his back.  
From where you sit, thin smoke curls from the chamber’s vents.  
Labels on the cables read: NEURAL SYNC — ANCHOR LINKAGE POINT.

Insight DC 13
- **Success:** This isn’t subspace hardware. It's modified medical tech. An interface chamber for... live syncronization?
- **Failure:** It looks like another NT Prototype. Big, expensive, and beyond your pay grade.

The CentComm official from before, presumably Commander Gudrick, aises a glass and strides to the podium like a preacher before his flock.
> “Friends, crew, protectors of our great Company!  
> The Syndicate’s defeat at Barrier Gate proves the Frontier’s resolve.  
> But victory requires more than firepower — it requires continuity.  
> That is what we gain through Project Rebirth: a safeguard for the minds that lead us forward.”

He motions to Sten.
> “First Officer Varr has volunteered to pioneer this stabilization link —  
> a living connection between command, ship, and crew.  
> His thoughts will anchor the _Rebirth_ as we push into the Void.”

Murmurs ripple through the audience. Some clap, unsure why.  
Eidunn stands rigid, pale under the lights.

### Optional Actions
- **Question the Process (Persuasion DC 14):**  
    Gudrick waves it off with PR polish.
    > “All procedures cleared through Central Command. Enjoy the moment, officer.”
- **Approach Eidunn (Persuasion DC 10):**  
    She murmurs without looking up,
    > “It wasn’t supposed to be him… I— stay seated. Please.”
- **Perception DC 12:**  
    The capsule’s cable lights pulse faster, irregular — almost _panicked._

## The Upload
Gudrick extends his hand.  
Sten nods once and steps inside the chamber.

The hatch seals with a hiss. Lights dim.  
A low hum fills the room — growing louder, higher-pitched.
> “In service to stability,” Gudrick proclaims,  
> “we honor those who give themselves to the whole.  
> Sten Varr — your consciousness will never fade; it will forever guide us.”

The capsule flares white.  
Then — alarms.

Eidunn looks up sharply, sensing it before the others.  
A deep _boom_ shakes the walls.  
The projector flickers, emergency sirens blare.
> “WARNING: HULL BREACH DETECTED.”

Screams erupt outside.  
Officers draw weapons; engineers dive for cover.

The capsule still hums — louder, vibrating violently.  
Inside, Sten convulses, the light within flashing like lightning.  
Comms burst alive:
> “Syndicate breach!” “Close the blast doors!” “Push back!”

Eidunn shouts:
> “Cut the transfer! Now!”

Gudrick:*
> “We can’t! If we break the link, we lose everything!  
> Hold this chamber — the Anchor _must_ stay online!”

Then the Syndicate hits.  
Six figures in red pressure suits crash through opposite doors, axes and breaching tools in hand.

## Combat Phase: Defend the Pod
Objective: Keep Syndicate away for 4 rounds.  
If three reach the pod simultaneously, capsule integrity – 25%.

Round 1: 3 Syndicate Raiders 
Round 2: 2 Saboteurs with breaching charges
Round 3: 1 Heavy Raider with improvised shield and rifle.

**Stabilize Power (Int DC 14):**  
Can attempt once per round.
- **Success:** Restore 10% stability.
- **Failure:** Electrical surge (1d6 shock damage).

## Results:
Win: 
The final explosion rattles the theatre.  
The capsule blazes white, then goes silent.  
Power flickers back on; the NT crest flashes:
> STABILITY MAINTAINED…

Eidunn staggers back, shielding her eyes from the light.  
Somewhere deep in the mall, bulkheads slam shut.

Failure:
The glass implodes.  
Blue fire races across the floor cables.  
When it fades, Sten is gone — only a charred outline where he lay.  
The main display blinks crimson:
> SUBSPACE LINK UNVERIFIED

Gudrick snaps:
> “Get to the Rebirth! The ship’s still intact!”

Eidunn:
> “We can’t leave the civilians—”

Gudrick:
> “They’re not the mission! The link’s partial — if we don’t move now, the Syndicate wins!  
> All surviving crew, evac protocol!”

Eidunn hesitates at the threshold, staring at the ruined chamber.
> “Forgive me, Sten…”

Firedoors slam shut behind her as the room erupts in flame.
