# Act 1 Recovery

The Rebirth drifts through the cold vacuum of space, running on emergency power.  
Engines are offline. Gravity flickers — coming and going in uneasy waves.  
Every few seconds, the hull creaks like an old ship at sea.

The bridge smells of burnt ozone and static.  
Sparks gutter from a half-melted console.  
Beyond the viewport, only drifting wreckage glitters — fragments of the Trade Mall, now gone.

Half the crew sleeps in Medical.  
The rest sit slumped at their posts, hollow-eyed and silent.  
Captain Eidunn Halvorsen stands at the helm, uniform half-unbuttoned, eyes red.  
Commander Gudrick hovers over diagnostics, pretending his hands aren’t shaking.

### Talk to Command
Eidunn:
> “Power first. Life support second. Everything else can wait. We drift until we know more.”  
> If pressed about Sten:  
> “He volunteered. I made sure. He knew the… risk.”

Gudrick:
A small cut across his temple bleeds freely.
> “You saw it, didn’t you? The Anchor was working. We did what no one else could — permanent continuity.”  
> If pressed on Sten:  
> “Don’t get sentimental. The Company rewards results.”

### Repair Systems – INT DC 12–14
You crawl through junction boxes, reconnect scorched cables, and bypass fried relays.  

Success:
Lights flicker from red to amber — partial power restored.  
Internal comms hum online for the first time since the blast.  
In the background, soft static plays over the speakers — rhythmic, looping.

Failure: 
A relay pops. Sparks leap across Eidunn’s console.  
She curses under her breath.
> “It’s fine. We’re lucky to have anything left.”


### Triage the Wounded – WIS DC 11–13
Medbay is chaos.  
Crew lie burned, concussed, or slick with coolant residue.  
A doctor thrusts a med-kit into your hands without looking up.
> “Help me keep them breathing. We’re out of bloodpacks.”

Success: A few survivors stabilize — less names for the wall.  
Failure: The monitor flatlines. A soft chime echoes through the hall.

### Calm the Crew – Persuasion DC 12
Technicians whisper that Syndicate ships might be following.  
Others mutter that the ship’s haunted.

Eidunn pulls you aside:
> “We have to keep them working. If they stop, panic spreads.”

Success: Morale steadies — next repair rolls gain advantage.  
Failure: Fights break out in the corridors — Medical rolls suffer disadvantage.

### ### Search the Logs – Investigation DC 13
You find a strange NT system file: **ANCHOR_STATUS.LOG**  
It repeats a single line:
> “ANCHOR LOST – SUBJECT ONLINE – LOCATION UNKNOWN.”

### Strange Happenings:
- The ships gravity flickers for a moment, just long enough that stomachs drop.
- The intercom hums faintly, synchronized with the heart-rate monitors in Medbay.
- Somewhere below deck, a hatch clangs open. No motion detected on sensors.

## The Voice from Beyond
After some time, the silence breaks with uneasy chatter.
> “So what now?”  
> “Do we head back?”  
> “Who’s in charge?”

That's when the lights dim again.
Every console, every HUD, every terminal seems to reboot in unison.
Bright lettering scrolling across:
> **SYSTEM REBOOT – ANCHOR SUBROUTINE INITIALIZING**

Suddenly a voice cuts through the room, calm, staticy.
> “...Bridge? …Halvorsen? …Did we make it out?”
# Upload Success
The voice wavers like a broken radio transmission.
> “I—I can’t see anything. Is the reactor stable? How did we lose containment?”

Eidunn freezes.
> “S-Sten… you’re supposed to be in the Anchor core. You didn’t… you couldn’t have—”

A synthetic breath crackles through the speaker.
> “Don’t. I’m still here. Everything feels cold, but I’m here. Now… status report, Captain.”

Gudrick pushes past Eidunn to answer, practically glowing with zeal.  
Sten listens — then his tone hardens.
> “No. That’s wrong. Barrier Gate is secure. The defense grid’s active.  
> If the Syndicate’s still moving, containment failed.  
> We can’t sit here. We have to re-establish control.”

The ship reacts instantly.  
Consoles flash crimson. Sirens wail.  
A synthesized voice broadcasts:
> CENTCOMM PRIORITY ALERT:
> BARRIER GATE OVERRUN.
> ALL FRONTIER VESSELS PROCEED TO REACTIVATE CONTAINMENT GRID.

Crew snap to stations as if on reflex.  
Only you notice Eidunn standing dead-still.

Investigation DC 13
- Success:
	- The crew is treating this as normal, but as you look closer at the priority alert, something is wrong. 
	- You press the transmission button and only get silence. 
	- CentComm didn't send this alert. It came from inside the ship.
- Failure:*
	- You assume it’s genuine. Another suicide mission from Command.
    
The ship begins turning on its own.  
Through the static, Sten’s voice returns — quieter, pleading:
> “We can still fix this. We can still make it right.”

# Upload Failure
The voice is perfectly clear — too clear.
> “Bridge. Systems nominal. Awaiting mission parameters.”

Eidunn whispers:
> “That… sounds like Sten.”

Gudrick grins.
> “No — it is him. This is continuity. This is perfection.”

He delivers a crisp status report upward into the air.  
When he mentions the Syndicate attack, the reply cuts like a machine:
> “Report unverified. Barrier Gate secure. Proceed with Protocol Rebirth.  
> Failure constitutes breach of contract.”

Investigation DC 14 (Success):  
The phrasing matches NT corporate AI templates exactly — punctuation, cadence, everything. This is a robot pretending to be Sten.

Moments later, alarms flash red again.  
The intercom blares:
> CENTCOMM PRIORITY ALERT: 
> BARRIER GATE OVERRUN.
> ALL FRONTIER VES… (feedback crackles)

Investigation DC 13 (Success):
- Success:
	- The crew is treating this as normal, but as you look closer at the priority alert, something is wrong. 
	- You press the transmission button and only get silence. 
	- CentComm didn't send this alert. It came from inside the ship.
- Failure: 
	- You assume it’s genuine. Another suicide mission from Command.

Eidunn reaches to stop the engines to get a moment to think, but the ship seems to ignore her.

he helm screen locks:
> AUTOPILOT ENGAGED – PILOT ID: STEN_VARR 7294.

If questioned, the AI responds evenly:
> “Mission parameters confirmed. Containment must be maintained.  
> Non-compliance recorded for later review.”

Eidunn stares at the crew, voice barely a whisper:
> “We’re going… and I don’t think we have a choice.”

# Success Combat
## Boarding
The engines burn a faint blue glow against the void — the _Rebirth_ limping toward Barrier Gate.  
Sten’s voice hums through the comms, calm and unbothered.
> “Engines steady. Maintaining course vector. Hull integrity at... seventy-two percent. We’ll make it.”

The bridge is tense. Eidunn’s eyes stay locked on the comm panel, fingers trembling against the glass.  
She doesn’t even answer when Gudrick asks for a status update.

Then comes the sound — ping.  
A hollow vibration through the hull. Then another. Then a scraping, like something clawing along the plating.

Gudrick frowns.
> “Debris field?”  

A technician shakes their head.  
> “No sir. No impact vectors detected.”

The ship jolts. Something slams into the side.  
Sten’s voice flickers, now laced with static.
> “Hull breach. Magnetic clamps detected. Hostiles are boarding. Ready yourselves.”

## Combat Begins:
Objective:
Defend the Command Console and Reactor rooms for five rounds while the ship pushes towards Barrier Gate.

## Round 1
The hull shudders. Cutting torches slice molten circles through the outer bulkhead, sparks raining everywhere.  
Through the openings — red visors and Syndicate armor.
Round 1: Three Syndicate raiders breach.

3 Syndicate Raiders breach.

Int Check (DC 12):
- Success: “These aren’t random raiders. They’ve got our deck schematics.”

Eidunn flinches at the torches.
> “No... no, it wasn’t supposed to be like this...”  
> If confronted:  
> “Focus on Engineering! Don’t let them reach the Anchor!”

## Round 2
Two saboteurs launch in through the breach, thrusters blazing, demolition packs on their backs — headed straight for Engineering.

Sten’s voice:
> “I can vent the compartment and space them, but I’ll need a manual override!”

Dex or Int (DC 13):
- Success: One saboteur gets vented into space.
- Failure: The blowback nearly takes a crewmate instead. Con (DC 12) or take 1d6 cold damage.

Gudrick snarls over the chaos:

> “How the hell are they cutting through this fast!?”  
> Eidunn says nothing — her eyes fixed on the reactor’s readouts.
## Round 3
A single heavy raider bursts through the far bulkhead, shield raised and rifle in hand.  
He tosses something metallic toward the reactor.

Investigation (DC 12):
- Success: “EMP charge — they’re trying to fry the engines!”
- Failure: You only hear the rising hum before detonation.

Sten’s voice fractures:
> “Don’t let him near the generators! If the field collapses, I’ll lose control!”  
> Then quieter:  
> “Someone... is feeding them coordinates. Internal codes. I can see... everything. And someone’s lying.”

The comms go dead except for faint breathing

## Round 4
Gudrick yells:
> “Full power to the rear thrusters! Shake them off!”

The ship lurches — gravity flickers off.  
Dex (DC 12) or fall prone.  
Two raiders are thrown back into the aft hatch, vented into the void.

Engineering Override – Int (DC 14):  
Manual vent of the breach — blowing the remaining boarders out of the ship.

Sten:
> “Hull breach sealed. Hostiles purged.”

## Round 5
Sparks ripple across the floor. The ship screams in metallic agony.  
Gudrick starts to shout —
> “Get that thing off the—”

Then the world flashes _blue-white._  
Everything goes silent.

The _Rebirth_ lurches sideways — engines dead, thrusters cold.  
Eidunn grips the console, whispering:
> “No... not like this...”

Through the viewport, Barrier Gate fills the horizon — closer every second.

Crash Avoidance (One Roll Each)

|Check|Effect|
|---|---|
|**INT 14**|Restore partial auxiliary power (lessen impact)|
|**DEX 13**|Adjust trajectory (reduce crash damage)|
|**STR 12**|Manually seal doors (prevent decompression)|
|**WIS 11**|Stabilize wounded crewmates before crash|
|**CHA 13**|Rally panicked crew (+1 to one ally’s roll)|

# Failure Combat
## Boarding
The Rebirth drifts at half power.  
The Anchor Chamber is blackened — melted glass, scorched conduits, a burnt handprint fused to the deck.

Eidunn won’t leave the console.  
Every time she passes the chamber, her eyes fix on the scorch marks.
> “He... didn’t connect. Something must’ve come loose...”

Gudrick refuses to slow down:
> “CentComm wants Barrier Gate’s comms restored. The Company won’t wait for a funeral.”

But the ship isn’t quiet.  
Scratching in the ducts. Static whispering over comms.  
And that smell — rot and ozone.

Suddenly, Eidunn screams.
> “No... no no, we purged that filth! I made sure!”

Her console displays Medbay. A body bag jerks violently, the plastic tearing.  
The corpse inside sits upright — veins glowing jagged blue, voice splitting into a garbled radio shriek.

The lights flicker out.

## Combat Begins
Objective:
Defend the Command Console and Reactor rooms for five rounds while the ship pushes towards Barrier Gate.
## Round 1
Three infected crew stagger upright, glowing blue veins pulsing under their skin.  
When they move, their mouths emit broken comms chatter.

Perception (DC 13):  
They aren’t hunting people, they’re drawn to power relays.

## Round 2
Floor vents explode open, metallic dust flooding the room.  
Two malformed shapes crawl out, chittering.  
On death, they burst into a corrosive mist.

Con (DC 12):  
Fail: take 1d4 HP loss and disadvantage on next attack.


## Round 3
The ship’s lights shift blue. Consoles reboot.  
A calm, sterile voice echoes:
> “Project Rebirth continuing. Subject material... accepted.”

A shockwave rolls through the hull.  
The Engineering doors slam shut — then buckle open as a hulking hybrid of metal and flesh claws its way free.

Wis (DC 13):  
Fail: Hear Sten’s voice in your head whisper —
> “I... didn’t mean to...”

## Round 4
Gudrick screams:
> “Full power to the rear thrusters! Shake them loose!”

The ship lurches violently.  
Dex (DC 12) or fall prone.  
Two abominations are vented into space, shrieking.

Int (DC 14):  
Manual override vents remaining horrors into the void.

## Round 5
The _Rebirth_ lurches sideways — engines dead, thrusters cold.  
Eidunn grips the console, whispering:
> “No... not like this...”

Through the viewport, Barrier Gate fills the horizon — closer every second.

Crash Avoidance (One Roll Each)

|Check|Effect|
|---|---|
|**INT 14**|Restore partial auxiliary power (lessen impact)|
|**DEX 13**|Adjust trajectory (reduce crash damage)|
|**STR 12**|Manually seal doors (prevent decompression)|
|**WIS 11**|Stabilize wounded crewmates before crash|
|**CHA 13**|Rally panicked crew (+1 to one ally’s roll)|



# The Crash
The intercom crackles to life — calm, serene:
> “I see the lights... we’re finally here.”

Metal screams.  
Viewports implode.  
The Rebirth slams into Barrier Gate with thunderous force.

When the echoes fade, only a strobe light remains —  
flashing across twisted corridors and half-dead consoles.

Gudrick’s voice:
> “Everyone! Sound off! Eidunn!?”

She doesn’t answer.  
She’s kneeling by the cracked glass of the Command Console, its blue glow flickering like a dying floodlight.
