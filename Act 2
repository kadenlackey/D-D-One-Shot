# Act 1 Recovery

The Rebirth drifts through the cold vacuum of space, running on emergency power.  
Engines are offline. Gravity flickers — coming and going in uneasy waves.  
Every few seconds, the hull creaks like an old ship at sea.

The bridge smells of burnt ozone and static.  
Sparks gutter from a half-melted console.  
Beyond the viewport, only drifting wreckage glitters — fragments of the Trade Mall, now gone.

Half the crew sleeps in Medical.  
The rest sit slumped at their posts, hollow-eyed and silent.  
Captain Eidunn Halvorsen stands at the helm, uniform half-unbuttoned, eyes red.  
Commander Gudrick hovers over diagnostics, pretending his hands aren’t shaking.

### Talk to Command
Eidunn:
> “Power first. Life support second. Everything else can wait. We drift until we know more.”  
> If pressed about Sten:  
> “He volunteered. I made sure. He knew the… risk.”

Gudrick:
A small cut across his temple bleeds freely.
> “You saw it, didn’t you? The Anchor was working. We did what no one else could — permanent continuity.”  
> If pressed on Sten:  
> “Don’t get sentimental. The Company rewards results.”

### Repair Systems – INT DC 12–14
You crawl through junction boxes, reconnect scorched cables, and bypass fried relays.  

Success:
Lights flicker from red to amber — partial power restored.  
Internal comms hum online for the first time since the blast.  
In the background, soft static plays over the speakers — rhythmic, looping.

Failure: 
A relay pops. Sparks leap across Eidunn’s console.  
She curses under her breath.
> “It’s fine. We’re lucky to have _anything_ left.”


### Triage the Wounded – WIS DC 11–13
Medbay is chaos.  
Crew lie burned, concussed, or slick with coolant residue.  
A doctor thrusts a med-kit into your hands without looking up.
> “Help me keep them breathing. We’re out of bloodpacks.”

**Success:** A few survivors stabilize — less names for the wall.  
**Failure:** The monitor flatlines. A soft chime echoes through the hall.

### Calm the Crew – Persuasion DC 12
Technicians whisper that Syndicate ships might be following.  
Others mutter that the ship’s haunted.

Eidunn pulls you aside:
> “We have to keep them working. If they stop, panic spreads.”

**Success:** Morale steadies — next repair rolls gain advantage.  
**Failure:** Fights break out in the corridors — Medical rolls suffer disadvantage.

### ### Search the Logs – Investigation DC 13
You find a strange NT system file: **ANCHOR_STATUS.LOG**  
It repeats a single line:
> “ANCHOR LOST – SUBJECT ONLINE – LOCATION UNKNOWN.”

### Strange Happenings:
- The ships gravity flickers for a moment, just long enough that stomachs drop.
- The intercom hums faintly, synchronized with the heart-rate monitors in Medbay.
- Somewhere below deck, a hatch clangs open. No motion detected on sensors.

## The Voice from Beyond
After some time, the silence breaks with uneasy chatter.
> “So what now?”  
> “Do we head back?”  
> “Who’s in charge?”

That's when the lights dim again.
Every console, every HUD, every terminal seems to reboot in unison.
Bright lettering scrolling across:
> **SYSTEM REBOOT – ANCHOR SUBROUTINE INITIALIZING**

Suddenly a voice cuts through the room, calm, staticy.
> “...Bridge? …Halvorsen? …Did we make it out?”
# Upload Success
The voice wavers like a broken radio transmission.
> “I—I can’t see anything. Is the reactor stable? How did we lose containment?”

Eidunn freezes.
> “S-Sten… you’re supposed to be in the Anchor core. You didn’t… you _couldn’t_ have—”

A synthetic breath crackles through the speaker.
> “Don’t. I’m still here. Everything feels cold, but I’m here. Now… status report, Captain.”

Gudrick pushes past Eidunn to answer, practically glowing with zeal.  
Sten listens — then his tone hardens.
> “No. That’s wrong. Barrier Gate is secure. The defense grid’s active.  
> If the Syndicate’s still moving, containment failed.  
> We can’t sit here. We have to re-establish control.”

The ship reacts instantly.  
Consoles flash crimson. Sirens wail.  
A synthesized voice broadcasts:
> CENTCOMM PRIORITY ALERT:
> BARRIER GATE OVERRUN.
> ALL FRONTIER VESSELS PROCEED TO REACTIVATE CONTAINMENT GRID.

Crew snap to stations as if on reflex.  
Only you notice Eidunn standing dead-still.

Investigation DC 13
- **Success:** 
	- The crew is treating this as normal, but as you look closer at the priority alert, something is wrong. 
	- You press the transmission button and only get silence. 
	- CentComm didn't send this alert. It came from inside the ship.
- **Failure:** 
	- You assume it’s genuine. Another suicide mission from Command.
    
The ship begins turning on its own.  
Through the static, Sten’s voice returns — quieter, pleading:
> “We can still fix this. We can still make it right.”

# Upload Failure
The voice is perfectly clear — too clear.
> “Bridge. Systems nominal. Awaiting mission parameters.”

Eidunn whispers:
> “That… sounds like Sten.”

Gudrick grins.
> “No — it is him. This is continuity. This is perfection.”

He delivers a crisp status report upward into the air.  
When he mentions the Syndicate attack, the reply cuts like a machine:
> “Report unverified. Barrier Gate secure. Proceed with Protocol Rebirth.  
> Failure constitutes breach of contract.”

**Investigation DC 14 (Success):**  
The phrasing matches NT corporate AI templates exactly — punctuation, cadence, everything. This is a robot pretending to be Sten.

Moments later, alarms flash red again.  
The intercom blares:
> CENTCOMM PRIORITY ALERT: 
> BARRIER GATE OVERRUN.
> ALL FRONTIER VES… (feedback crackles)

Investigation DC 13 (Success):
- **Success:** 
	- The crew is treating this as normal, but as you look closer at the priority alert, something is wrong. 
	- You press the transmission button and only get silence. 
	- CentComm didn't send this alert. It came from inside the ship.
- **Failure:** 
	- You assume it’s genuine. Another suicide mission from Command.

Eidunn reaches to stop the engines to get a moment to think, but the ship seems to ignore her.

he helm screen locks:
> **AUTOPILOT ENGAGED – PILOT ID: STEN_VARR 7294.**

If questioned, the AI responds evenly:
> “Mission parameters confirmed. Containment must be maintained.  
> Non-compliance recorded for later review.”

Eidunn stares at the crew, voice barely a whisper:
> “We’re going… and I don’t think we have a choice.”

# The Assault
# Success Combat
## Boarding
The engines begin to burn a weak blue against the darkness, barely above idle.
Barrier gate a distant glimmer of light in the various debris of space.

Stens's voice rings out a calm status update:
"Engines steady. Maintaining course vector. Hull integrity at... 72%. We'll make it."

The crew is tense, and Eidunn keeps glancing down at the comm panel. 
Her head is low, her hands trembling as she touches the glass interface.
She doesnt even seem to answer when Gudrick asks for a ship update.

Then there's a soft 'ping'
A hollow sound through the hull taking hold.
Then another.
Then something sounds as if it were clawwing the sides of the ship.

Gudrick frowns.
"Debris field?"

A technician shakes there head.
"No sir. No impact vectors detected."

Something hard slams into the side of the ship.
Sten's hollow voice seems to cry out without much emotion.
"Hull breach. Magnetic clamps detected. Hostiles are boarding, ready yourself for combat!"

## Combat Begins:
Objective:
Defend the Command Console and Reactor rooms for five rounds while the ship pushes towards Barrier Gate.

## Round 1
The hull shudders as the sounds of torches cut through the outer bulkhead. Sparks raining down everywhere. Through the hull openings are red visors, Syndicate.
Round 1: Three Syndicate raiders breach.

Int Check - DC12
Success "These werent random raiders. They have deck schematics."
Eidun flinches as she hears the torches, trying to rapidly adjust course on the console.
"No... no it wasn't supposed to be like this..."
If confronted:
"Keep your focus on getting to the engine!"

## Round 2
Two Saboteurs propel through the breach on open thrusters, carrying demolition packs, aimed straight for Engineering.

Sten: "I can vent the atmos and space them, but I need a manual override."
Dex or Int DC 13:
Success: One Saboteur gets vented
Failure: The failure nearly takes a crewmate instead. Con DC 12 or take 1d6 cold damage.

Gudrick shouts:
"How the HELL are they cutting through this fast?"
Eidunn isn't responding.
Her eyes focused on the reactor readings.
## Round 3
The final raider: A Breacher with reinforced shields and rifle, bursting right infront of the reactor. Tossing something metallic infront of it.

Investigation DC 12
Success: It's an EMP, they're trying to shut down the engines to make us easy pickings.

Sten: "Don't let him touch the generators! The device could sever my connection to help."

The ship shakes violently.
"Someones... feeding them coordinates... internal codes..."
"I can see... everything. And someones lying."

The comms go quiet except a low gentle breathing.

## Round 4
Gudrick shouts out: "Full power to the rear thrusters! We shake them off!"

The ship lurches and gravity momentarily turns off.
Dex DC 12 or fall prone
Up to two raiders slam into the rear hatch, the doors venting them momentarily.

Emergency Override Int DC 14
Triggering manual vent of the room to blow remaining syndicate into space.

Sten: "Hull breach sealed. Hostiles purged"

## Round 5
Sparks ripple from the engine. The whole ship screaming in agony.
Gudrick "Get that thing off the-"

Everything lights in a billiant shade of blue, then it all goes dark.
The Rebirth lurches sideways. The engines sputtering once more before dying completely.

Eidunn: "No... no no no, not like this - "

Out the front of the window is Barrier Gate, the ship flying towards it still at full momentum from evasive maneuvers.

Each player may make ONE roll
Int - 14 - Restore partial Auxilary power (Lessen crash impact)
Dex -13 - Adjust trajectory (reduce damage by redirecting location)
Str - 12 - Manually seal doors to prevent decompression
Wis - 11 - Stabilize wounded crew before crash
Cha - 13 - Rally panicking crew to brace (+1 to one future roll)

# Failure Combat
## Boarding
The engines crawl through the void at half power.
The Anchor chamber is cold and silent. Blackened glass, melted conduits, and scorch marks on the floor.

Eidunn won't leave the console.
Every time she passes, her reddened eyes are fixed on the floor.
If asked: "He... didn't connect... something must have gotten loose"

Gudric insists:
"CentComm wants Barrier Gate's comms restored. The company wont wait for a simple funeral."

But the ship isn't quiet. There's scratching in the ducts. Whispering voices over comms. A strange smell of Rot in the air.

Eidunn can be heard crying out suddenly:
"No... no no no we purged that filth! I made sure!"

On the screen to her console is a body bag in medbay shifting, almost violently.
The plastic tearing open with a snap as the corpse inside sits upright.
Its veins are pulsing with a blue powerful light jagged across it.
Its body convulses, spine cracking backwards as it lets out a sound mixed between a scream and a static burst.
The lights begin to flicker.

## Combat Begins
Objective:
Defend the Command Console and Reactor rooms for four rounds while the ship pushes towards Barrier Gate.
## Round 1
Three infected crew stagger to their feet. Their eyes glowing faintly blue.
They move unnaturally.
Their mouths are open, sounds like mimicked radio comms play through them.
The Anchor core pulses each time they move

Perception DC 13:
They seem to be attracted to power relays rather than crew.

## Round 2
The vents in the floor burst open, releasing clouds of metallic dust.
 Two malformed shapes crawl from the corridors.
	 On death they burst into a dust, all within 5 ft make a Con save DC 12 or lose 1d4 HP and get disadvantage on next attack.


## Round 3
The lights in the room shift.
Every console seems to reboot.
The sterile monotone voice over the intercomm speaks.
"Project Rebirth continuing. Subject Material: Accepted."

A wave of light pulses from the engine room.
The doors slam shut, then there is the sounds of clawwing as they are pried back open with massive hulking hands.

A beast of horror made from flesh and metal rips its way out.
Wis save DC 13
On Failure: The voice of Sten whispers into your head pleading.
"I... I didn't mean to..."

## Round 4
Gudrick shouts out: "Full power to the rear thrusters! We shake them off!"

The ship lurches and gravity momentarily turns off.
Dex DC 12 or fall prone
Up to two enemies slam into the rear hatch, the doors venting them momentarily.

Emergency Override Int DC 14
Triggering manual vent of the room to blow remaining abominations into space.


# The Crash
A moment before impact, the intercoms crackle to life

The voice over the intercom calm and serene:
"I see the lights, we're finally here"

Metal screams. Viewports implode.
The ship crashes into Barrier gate with a sound like thunder in the vacuum of space.

When the noises finally calm down, only a strobe light remains.
Outside is the ruins of Barrier Gate.

Gudrick "Everyone! Sound off! Eidunn?"

She doenst answer. She's struggling to stand, looking at the cracked glass console of the command console cracked and blinking like a dying floodlight.
