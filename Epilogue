# Route 1-A
Weeks later, the Frontier is running smoothly again.
Trade mall hums to life again. The warfront is quiet.
From the depths of Barrier gate, once every cycle, a soft beacon pings.

Whenever it is decrypted, the message is always a single phrase.
"Crew secure. Frontier stable."

Rumors spread that there's a ghost watching over the crew in the sector. Syndicate signals dropping dead mid-transmission.
Those who pay any attention swear the Frontier has an invisible guardian.
And if you're ever on Barrier Gate, and listen really closely, the hums of the machinery almost sound like a heartbeat.

# Route 1-B
NanoTrasens public report lists Project Rebirth as "terminated in initial phases."
Barrier Gate is still active under remote command.

A memorian file circulates, with Sten Varr's name among the title, awarded for "Exemplary Service Record."

Eidunn never speaks during the ceremony.
She just keeps her eyes on the stars.

But in the maintenance bays of Trade Mall, there's a single display still flickering.
Static covers the screen, but occassionally there is the form of a faint human silhouette passing by, as if saying.
"I'm still here."

# Route 2-A

NanoTrasen's announcement comes two days later.

"Barrier Gate is restored. All systems are nominal. Project Rebirth is temporarily suspended and pending reevaluation."

Engineers publically claim the internal systems wiped themselves clean as a precaution to a rogue virus.

But every so often, an automated log uploads a singular fragment of code, each one containing the same line, endlessly filled through the document.

"Continuity: Corrupted. Attempting to Reboot: Error."

And in a sector far away, an NT administrator frowns as their terminal seems to restart on its own. Just for a moment.

A voice seeming to whisper out through the speakers.
"I see youuuu."

# Route 2-B

A week after Barrier Gate's "reactivation" every terminal across the Frontier updates in unison.
A new sleek interface. New tone and everything.
The NT logo replaced by a single word: REBIRTH

Ships are running perfectly.
There are no malfunctions. No dissent.
Crews reports are filed, and vanish almost as soon as they are sent, replaced with "Acknowledged."

Those who can still dream, still say they hear voices.
A soft, calm, synthetic voice repeating the same phrase over and over:
"Continuity ensures Stability. Stability ensures peace. And peace always endures."

NanoTrasen calls it progress.
But every once in awhile, screens seem to flicker for half a second, as if something is struggling to wake up.
